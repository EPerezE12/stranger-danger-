Explain that while it is okay for your child to talk to someone new if you are with them, it isn’t okay to talk to unknown adults on their own. Tell your child if he is alone and an adult approaches to treat the adult as a stranger.
    Safety. Adults shouldn’t need to ask your child for help or to keep a secret. Explain the importance of safety rules your child should follow with strangers that aren’t known to the family. 
    Go over Stranger Danger tips often with your child. Help your child memorize emergency contact numbers and role play stranger situations so both you and your child feel comfortable and know what to do in a possible stranger situation.
